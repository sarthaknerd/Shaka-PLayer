ðŸ“¹ Shaka Player with IMA Ads
Shaka Player is a free and open-source HTML5 video player that can be used to play adaptive streaming video content. It supports DASH and HLS streaming protocols and can be easily integrated into web and mobile applications.

With the integration of IMA (Interactive Media Ads) SDK, Shaka Player now supports the ability to play pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll video ads. The ads are seamlessly integrated into the video content without interrupting the user's viewing experience. This feature is particularly useful for content creators and publishers who want to monetize their video content.

To use Shaka Player with IMA Ads, you will need to:

Include the Shaka Player and IMA SDK libraries in your HTML file.

Create a new instance of the Shaka Player and configure it to use IMA Ads.

Provide the ad tag URL and set the ad break information, such as the type of ads (pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll) and the time at which they should be played.

Initialize the player and load the video content and ad information.

Start playing the video and ads.

Please refer to the documentation and sample code provided in the Shaka Player Github repository for more detailed instructions on how to use the player with IMA Ads.

ðŸ”— Shaka Player is continuously updated, for the most recent version please check the official website https://shaka-player-demo.appspot.com/docs/api/tutorial-ima.html

ðŸš¨ Note: It's important to check the IMA SDK and Shaka Player's license compatibility before implementation.
